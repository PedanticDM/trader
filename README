Welcome to  Star Traders!  This is a  simple game of interstellar trading,
where the  objective is to create  companies, buy and  sell shares, borrow
and repay money, in order to become the wealthiest player (the winner).


Installation
============

Full instructions  for installing  Star Traders  are contained in the file
INSTALL.  Please note that that file does NOT contain generic GNU Autoconf
instructions!  For the impatient, the short version is:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The final command  needs to be run as the  system administrator (root), of
course.


How to Play
===========

Star Traders  comes with quite  extensive in-built instructions on  how to
play the game.  Start by running "trader" from the command line.  You will
be prompted for  the number of players; from one to  eight people can play
(although, in this  version, they will all have to  share the one keyboard
and screen!).  After entering the names  of the players, you will have the
opportunity to  read instructions  on how to  play the game.   Do so---and
good luck in the game!

The manual page for Star Traders contains more information on command line
options, as well as some  suggestions for running a retro-computing green-
screen nostalgia-tour  version of the game...  Try  running the following,
for example (all on one line):

    xterm -g 80x24 -fa Mono -fs 18 -bg '#181818' -fg '#2CAB00' -bc +sb \
        +bdc +fbx -xrm 'XTerm*colorBD: #41FF00' -e trader --no-colour &

To read the manual page, type "man trader" from the command line.
