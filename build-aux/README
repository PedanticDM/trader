This directory, build-aux, contains auxiliary build-related files for Star
Traders.  The following scripts are specific to this package:

    bootstrap        - Generate auxiliary files needed for building
    msgfmt-desktop   - Use msgfmt(1) or cp(1) to copy desktop files

All other files in this directory (other than this README file, of course)
are generated by Autoconf, Automake or Gnulib.  The bootstrap shell script
generates these files by running those tools in the correct order; see the
top-level INSTALL file for more details.
